          Grants players using melee weapons higher accuracy, thus increasing
          the number of hits dealt to an opponent during any given time period.
          Since more of the player's hits will be successful, the player's
          opponent will incur more damage per any given period of time. Stronger
          weapons also require higher levels of attack in order to equip. Grants
          access to melee abilities.
